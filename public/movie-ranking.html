<h1>The Best Movies According to Alex Armas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This movie took my breath away when I saw it in the movie theatres. It really expanded my mind and I left feeling so in awe by the theories and possibilites of the universe.</p>

<h3>I Am Legend</h3>
<p> This movie with Will Smith was incredible. The whole concept was such fun and exciting story to wrap the head around and put yourself in those shoes. Since then I have thought what I would do if I were the last one standing.</p>

<h3>The Hateful Eight</h3>
<p>Just an amazing adventure and so uniquely filmed and directed. I loved the tension and twists and how it kept me on my toes. The acting is phenomenal with sucha  variety of characters to explore.</p>
